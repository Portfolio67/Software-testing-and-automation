* How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

With the use of the agile software development lifecycle and incorporating testing into each user story is the best way to ensure that the codes functional qualities work and the testing portion has been completed.  This incremental approach ensures that their isn't technical debt at the end of the project as would be the case for a waterfall model.  Design patterns are a great way to ensure the code is functional and secure because they're tried and tested. For instance only using setters and getters so that accessing the object can only be done in certain areas of the code.
* How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The first step is to get the system requirements from the user and continue this to the elicitation process. This is a part of the agile development life cycle. At the end of the cycle the user can test out the working product and see if it meets the users needs.

* How do I approach designing software?

The design is based off the system requirements comes from the client or user. Then an analysis is made on the system requirementsã€‚ I also use common design patterns that have security in mind. This design patterns are tried and tested.
